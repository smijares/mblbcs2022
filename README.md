# Multiband deep learning models for hyperspectral remote sensing images compression
Repository with the models to replicate the results from the "Multiband deep learning models for hyperspectral remote sensing images compression" paper by Sebastià Mijares i Verdú, Valero Laparra, Johannes Ballé, Joan Bartrina-Rapesta, Miguel Hernández-Cabronero, and Joan Serra-Sagristà, submitted for publication in the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters journal in July 2022.
## What is in this repository
In this repository you will find the architecture developed for the paper, the models we trained to replicate our results, and a framework to run these models in a simple manner. To fully replicate our results, you may want to use the GICI implementations of [JPEG 2000](http://gici.uab.cat/BOI/) and [RKLT](http://gici.uab.cat/GiciApps/rklt.tar.gz) we used. Our tests sets can be found in the [GICI datasets](https://gici.uab.cat/GiciWebPage/datasets.php) site, which include the information on how they were obtained and pre-processed.
